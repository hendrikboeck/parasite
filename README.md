## Why?

Data and object validation in Python is essential to ensure that the inputs to a program are
accurate and adhere to expected formats, thereby preventing runtime errors and enhancing code
reliability. The TypeScript library `zod` offers a concise and expressive syntax for schema
validation, making it easier to define and enforce data structures. Implementing a similar library
in Python would greatly benefit developers by providing a streamlined, declarative approach to
validation, reducing boilerplate code and improving maintainability. This would facilitate more
robust data handling and enhance the overall quality of Python applications.

## What about the name?

I chose the name "Parasite" for this library because it draws heavy inspiration from the TypeScript
`zod` library, which excels in schema validation with its concise and expressive syntax. The name
"Parasite" is also a nod to one of Superman's iconic supervillains, serving as an homage to the
library that inspired this creation.

## Getting Started

### Installing

Install using `pip`:

```sh
pip install parasite
```

Install using `poetry` CLI:

```sh
poetry add parasite
```

or using `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
parasite = "^0.1.0"
```

### Example usage

```python
from parasite import p

schema = p.obj({
    "name": p.string().required(),
    "age": p.number().integer().min(0).optional(),
}).strip()

data = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 42,
    "extra": "This will be stripped",
}

schema.parse(data)   # {'name': 'John Doe', 'age': 42}
schema.parse({})   # ValidationError: Missing required key: 'name'
```
